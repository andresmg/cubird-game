            <h5>How to play</h5>
            <p>
              The winner will be the first player to meet one of these two
              conditions:
            </p>
            <h5 class="obj">Have 7 different flocks</h5>
            <img
              src="./images/siete-especies.svg"
              alt="objetivo siete especies"
            />
            <p class="text-center">OR</p>
            <h5 class="obj">
              Have 2 different flocks, with 3 birds in each one
            </h5>
            <img
              src="./images/dos-especies.svg"
              alt="objetivo dos especies"
              height="160"
            />

            <h5>Game summary</h5>
            <p>
              It is played in successive rounds. At the beginning of each round,
              each player starts with 8 cards in hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              On his turn, the player chooses a type of bird flock from his deck
              and place the card on an empty block of his choice that is to the
              right of each activated row. The player takes away all the bird
              cards and the ones he has just placed and updating his deck flocks
              with the new birds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then three new bird species are automatically added to the
              selected row.
            </p>

            <h5>Complete a flock</h5>
            <p>
              A flock is a set of birds of the same species. Completing a flock
              allows the player to add one or two cards to their collection.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each species has two numbers in its upper right corner, the one on
              the left is the number of the <b>small flock</b> and the one on
              the right is the number of the <b>large flock</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              If a player has to his credit a number of birds of the same
              species greater than or equal to the number of the small flock,
              but less than the number of the large flock, a bird of that
              species is added to his flocks and the rest of the birds goes to
              the discard deck. If the player has to his credit a number of
              birds greater than or equal to the number of the large flock, two
              birds of that species are added to his collection and the rest
              goes to the discard deck.
            </p>

            <h5>Win</h5>
            <p>
              If a player has 7 different flocks (out of the 8 existing) in his
              collection, or 2 flocks with at least 3 birds in each at the end
              of his turn, wins the game.
            </p>
