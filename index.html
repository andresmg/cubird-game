          <h5>How to play</h5>
          <p>
            The winner will be the first player to meet one of these two conditions:
          </p>
          <h5 class="obj">Have 7 different species</h5>
          <img src="./images/siete-especies.svg" alt="objetivo siete especies" />
          <p class="text-center">OR</p>
          <h5 class="obj">Have 2 different species, with 3 birds in each one</h5>
          <img src="./images/dos-especies.svg" alt="objetivo dos especies" height="160" />

          <h5>Game summary</h5>
          <p>It is played in successive rounds. At the beginning of each round, each player starts with 8 cards in hand.
            On his turn, the player <b>must</b> lower one or more birds of the same species from his hand, and then he
            <b>can</b> complete a flock. The player chooses a type of bird from his hand and must lower all the birds of
            that species that he has in his hand. Place the card on an empty block of your choice that is to the left or
            right of each activated row. The player takes away all the bird cards and the ones he has just placed.</p>
          <p>Then three new bird species are automatically added to the selected row.</p>

          <h5>Complete a flock</h5>
          <p>A flock is a set of birds of the same species. Completing a flock allows the player to add one or two cards
            to their collection.</p>
          <p>Each species has two numbers in its upper right corner, the one on the left is the number of the small
            flock and the one on the right is the number of the large flock.</p>
          <p>If a player has to his credit a number of birds of the same species greater than or equal to the number of
            the small flock, but less than the number of the large flock, a bird of that species is added to his
            collection and the rest of the birds to the discard deck. If the player has to his credit a number of birds
            greater than or equal to the number of the large flock, two birds of that species are added to his
            collection and the rest goes to the discard deck.</p>

          <h5>Win</h5>
          <p>If a player has 7 different species (out of the 8 existing) in his collection, or 2 species with at least 3
            birds in each at the end of his turn, he wins the game.</p>

            by Catch Up Games, distributed by Blackrock Games y edit in spanish by Maldito Games.</small>
